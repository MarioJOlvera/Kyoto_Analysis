### Kyoto protocol, world performance analysis

For the present project, the team decided to analyze the effects of world accords on global pollution, we quickly though of the Kyoto Protocol which is the most known global accord on health/pollution concerns issued by the UN. So, we did research and found that the main expectation of the accord was to reduce at least 5% contaminating emissions for the 2008/2012 period when compared to the level of emissions of 1990. So, the aim of this project is to find out if this objective was reached and how the air pollution has developed in the last years.
